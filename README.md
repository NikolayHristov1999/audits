## 👋 Introduction

**Smart Contract Security Researcher**  
Specializing in identifying critical vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols through competitive audits on leading platforms.
My work consistently ranks in the top placements across public contests, demonstrating both technical depth and creativity in attack surface exploration.
I focus on:

🕵️ Deep protocol analysis (DEXs, lending, bridges, restaking, L2 infra)

🔒 Exploitable real-world scenarios with practical PoCs

📈 Clear, actionable reports that help teams secure their protocols before mainnet launch

Currently available for private audits, competitive engagements, and collaborations with security-focused teams.
